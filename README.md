# CoderAcademy Week 2

## This week we had 5 challenges (mainly on CSS). 

A great resource on Flexbox is this [cheatsheet.](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wZRwgDoY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/simonpaix/images/blob/main/blog/Flexbox_CheatSheet_LearnPine.png%3Fraw%3Dtrue)

A less serious (but still effective) resource is [Flex Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

### The challenges covered: 
1. Responsive Design
2. Flexbox
3. Effects and Animations
4. Typography
5. Sass

We also started discussing Agile project management and started using Trello! 

#### Class overview:
During Tuesdays class we started the creation of an example website to demonstrate flexbox and media queries. See the Readme [here.](https://github.com/xdaybreakerx/oct23-t1w2-responsivedesign)

During Thursdays class we looked at typography, media breakpoints, and pseudo-classes. 

During Saturdays class we:
- created a sitemap using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
- Created a wireframe with [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
- Built the header of the site, and styled with SASS.
