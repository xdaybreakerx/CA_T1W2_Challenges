# CoderAcademy Week 2

## This week we had 5 challenges (mainly on CSS). 

A great resource on Flexbox is this [cheatsheet.](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wZRwgDoY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://github.com/simonpaix/images/blob/main/blog/Flexbox_CheatSheet_LearnPine.png%3Fraw%3Dtrue)

A less serious (but still effective) resource is [Flex Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

### The challenges covered: 
1. Responsive Design
2. Flexbox
3. Effects and Animations
4. Typography
5. Sass

We also started discussing Agile project management and started using Trello!
